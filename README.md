Development of machine learning models to estimate DIC and total alkalinity (TA) in the NELME region using in-situ and satellite data.

In this collection of jupyter notebooks we use bottle data containing DIC and TA observations for the NE shelf region combined with satellite data to train machine learning models to estimate DIC and TA. We then apply the trained machine learning models on a combination of CTD, glider, profiler (World Ocean Database) and satellite data to estimate DIC and TA fields for the NE shelf region. We also develop and use versions of the machine learning models without satellite data as input features.
