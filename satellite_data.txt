Satellite data variables:

ADT: Absolute Dynamic Topography is the sea surface height above
geoid. ADT=SLA+MDT where MDT is the Mean Dynamic Topography.  Units: meters.

UGOS: Zonal component of geostrophic velocity. Units: m/s.

VGOS: Meridional component of geostrophic velocity. Units: m/s.

SLA: Sea Level Anomaly is the sea surface height above mean sea surface. Units:
meters.

UGOSA: Zonal component of geostrophic velocity anomalies. Units: m/s.

VGOSA: Meridional component of geostrophic velocity anomalies. Units: m/s.

SST: NOAA's 1/4-degree Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature
(OISST). Also known as Reynold's SST. Units: Celsius.
